# Air-quality-index-predictor-using-linear-regression

# Overview
This project is a simple and efficient machine learning application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various environmental features using linear regression. The repository contains the necessary code and documentation to understand, train, and test the predictive model.

# Features
-Data preprocessing and cleaning
-Linear Regression model implementation
-Evaluation of model performance
-Visualization of predictions versus actual values

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains environmental variables such as pollutant levels, weather conditions, and other factors affecting air quality. Ensure that you have a dataset in CSV format with appropriate columns before running the code.
