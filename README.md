# Air-quality-index-predictor-using-linear-regression

# Overview
  This project is a simple and efficient machine learning application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various environmental features using linear regression. The repository contains the 
  necessary code and documentation to understand, train, and test the predictive model.

# Features
  -Data preprocessing and cleaning
  -Linear Regression model implementation
  -Evaluation of model performance
  -Visualization of predictions versus actual values

# Dataset
  The dataset used for this project contains environmental variables such as pollutant levels, weather conditions, and other factors affecting air quality. Ensure that you have a dataset in CSV format with 
  appropriate columns before running the code.

# Installation
  -Prerequisites
   Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
   Python 3.x
   Required libraries listed in requirements.txt (if provided)

  -Steps to Set Up
   Clone the repository:

# Results
  The trained linear regression model provides predictions for AQI with a certain accuracy. Visualization plots help analyze the performance and highlight prediction trends.

# Visualisation
  -Scatter plot of predicted vs actual AQI values
  -Model performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE)
